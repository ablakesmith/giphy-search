## User Stories

Objective: Develop a Giphy search application with an intuitive user interface and efficient functionality.

Why: Provide users with a seamless experience for discovering and sharing memes through a well-designed application.

**Navigation Bar**
    - As a developer, I want to ensure the navigation bar is structured for responsiveness, allowing users to easily access different sections of the Giphy search application.

**Search Form**
    - As a developer, I aim to create a user-friendly form in the main section for users to input their favorite memes and select the number of gifs to display.

**Gif Display**
    - As a developer, I need to implement JavaScript functionality to handle form submission, fetching and displaying gifs related to the entered meme.

**Footer**
    - As a developer, I want to include a footer with a clickable Giphy logo, redirecting users to the Giphy website for additional exploration.
